### How Google analytics works

Essentially a platform that collects data, and compiles into reports

1. Create account
2. Add small bit of js to each site page &lt;script&gt;, and &lt;noscript&gt;

<p>
  Collects anonymous informations about how person interacted with page<br />
  1. Click locations, and number of page visits<br />
  2. Browser, Language, device, and OS<br />
  3. Referring page eg. Search engine, or email marketing campaign (utm_source)<br />
</p>

<p>
  Each page load results in updated metrics being sent to Google. This is bundled into a particular session for that user. Session ends after thirty minutes of inactivity.
</p>

<p>
  Each session aggregates up into reports, which is initially filtered by device, or browser, but these are configurable via settings, and filters (Country, or remove internal company traffic). <b>NB</b> Once data is stored it cannot be changed - DB perms INSERT, and SELECT only. Once processing has occurred it becomes available as reports.
